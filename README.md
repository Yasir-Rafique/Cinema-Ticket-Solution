# Cinema-Ticket-Solution
The solution includes a cinema ticket booking service with the capability to handle multiple ticket types (Adult, Child, Infant), enforce purchase rules, and provide testing with Jest.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name

Install dependencies:
npm install

Run the Jest test suite to verify the working of the solution:
npm jest

## **NOTE**:
In the just test file test/TicketServeTest.test.js
I have already defined 13 test cases which I believe are the important one.
Please feel free to edit existing test cases and add new of your own choice.
